# eBPF Tutorial by Example: Monitoring GPU Driver Activity with Kernel Tracepoints

When games stutter or ML training slows down, the answers lie inside the GPU kernel driver. Linux kernel tracepoints expose real-time job scheduling, memory allocation, and command submission data. Unlike userspace profiling tools that sample periodically and miss events, kernel tracepoints catch every operation with nanosecond timestamps and minimal overhead.

This tutorial shows how to monitor GPU activity using eBPF and bpftrace. We'll track DRM scheduler jobs, measure latency, and diagnose bottlenecks using stable kernel tracepoints that work across Intel, AMD, and Nouveau drivers.

## GPU Kernel Tracepoints: Zero-Overhead Observability

GPU tracepoints are instrumentation points built into the kernel's Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) subsystem. When your GPU schedules a job, allocates memory, or signals a fence, these tracepoints fire with precise timing and driver state.

The key insight: kernel tracepoints activate only when events occur, adding nanoseconds of overhead per event. They capture 100% of activity including microsecond-duration jobs. Polling-based monitoring checks GPU state every 100ms and misses short-lived operations entirely.

GPU tracepoints span three layers. DRM scheduler tracepoints (`gpu_scheduler` event group) are stable uAPI; their format never changes. They work identically across Intel, AMD, and Nouveau drivers for vendor-neutral monitoring. Vendor-specific tracepoints expose driver internals. Intel i915 tracks GEM object creation and VMA binding, while AMD AMDGPU monitors buffer objects and command submission. Generic DRM tracepoints handle display synchronization through vblank events for diagnosing frame drops.

## DRM Scheduler Monitor: Universal GPU Tracking

The `drm_scheduler.bt` script works on **all GPU drivers** because it uses stable uAPI tracepoints. It tracks job submission (`drm_run_job`), completion (`drm_sched_process_job`), and dependency waits (`drm_sched_job_wait_dep`) across all rings.

### Understanding the Script

The script attaches to three stable DRM scheduler tracepoints. When `drm_run_job` fires, a job transitions from "queued in software" to "running on silicon." The tracepoint captures `args->id` (job ID for correlation), `args->name` (ring name indicating which execution engine like graphics, compute, or video decode), `args->job_count` (queue depth indicating how many jobs are waiting), and `args->hw_job_count` (jobs currently executing on GPU hardware).

The format `entity=0xffff888... id=12345 fence=0xffff888... ring=gfx job count:5 hw job count:2` tells you job 12345 on the graphics ring started executing with 5 jobs queued behind it and 2 jobs currently running on hardware. Multi-engine GPUs can run jobs in parallel across different rings.

We record `@start[$job_id] = nsecs` to enable latency calculation. The script stores the timestamp keyed by job ID. Later, when tracking completion or measuring end-to-end latency, you can compute `nsecs - @start[$job_id]` to get execution time. The `@jobs_per_ring[$ring] = count()` line increments per-ring counters, showing workload distribution across engines.

When `drm_sched_process_job` fires, GPU hardware completed a job and signaled its fence. The fence pointer `args->fence` identifies the completed job. Correlating fence pointers between `drm_run_job` and this tracepoint lets you calculate GPU execution time: `completion_time - run_time = GPU_execution_duration`. If jobs that should take 5ms are taking 50ms, you've found a GPU performance problem.

The `drm_sched_job_wait_dep` tracepoint fires when a job blocks waiting for a fence. Before a job executes, its dependencies (previous jobs it waits for) must complete. The format shows `args->ctx` (dependency context) and `args->seqno` (sequence number) identifying which fence blocks this job.

This reveals pipeline stalls. If compute jobs constantly wait for graphics jobs, you're not exploiting parallelism. Long wait times suggest dependency chains are too deep - consider batching independent work. Excessive dependencies indicate CPU-side scheduling inefficiency. The `@waits_per_ring[$ring] = count()` metric tracks which rings experience the most dependency stalls.

At program end, the `END` block prints statistics. `@jobs_per_ring` shows job counts per execution engine - revealing if specific rings (video encode, compute) are saturated. `@waits_per_ring` exposes dependency bottlenecks. This data reveals overall GPU utilization patterns and whether jobs are blocked by dependencies.

## Intel i915 Tracepoints: Memory Management Deep Dive

Intel's i915 driver exposes detailed tracepoints for memory operations. These require `CONFIG_DRM_I915_LOW_LEVEL_TRACEPOINTS=y` in your kernel config; check with `grep CONFIG_DRM_I915_LOW_LEVEL_TRACEPOINTS /boot/config-$(uname -r)`.

i915_gem_object_create fires when the driver allocates a GEM (Graphics Execution Manager) object, the fundamental unit of GPU-accessible memory. Format: `obj=0xffff888... size=0x100000` indicates allocating a 1MB object. Track total allocated memory over time to detect leaks. Sudden allocation spikes before performance drops suggest memory pressure. Correlate object pointers with subsequent bind/fault events to understand object lifecycle.

i915_vma_bind tracks mapping memory into GPU address space. Allocating memory isn't enough; it must be bound into GPU virtual address space. Format: `obj=0xffff888... offset=0x0000100000 size=0x10000 mappable vm=0xffff888...` shows 64KB bound at GPU virtual address 0x100000. Frequent rebinding indicates memory thrashing, where the driver evicts and rebinds objects under pressure. GPU page faults often correlate with bind operations.

i915_gem_shrink captures memory pressure response. Under memory pressure, the driver reclaims GPU memory. Format: `dev=0 target=0x1000000 flags=0x3` means the driver tries to reclaim 16MB. High shrink activity indicates undersized GPU memory for the workload. Correlate with performance drops; if shrinking happens during frame rendering, it causes stutters.

i915_gem_object_fault tracks page faults when CPU or GPU accesses unmapped memory. Format: `obj=0xffff888... GTT index=128 writable` indicates a write fault on Graphics Translation Table page 128. Faults are expensive because they stall execution while the kernel resolves the missing mapping. Write faults are more expensive than reads since they require invalidating caches. GTT faults indicate incomplete resource binding before job submission.

## AMD AMDGPU Tracepoints: Command Submission Pipeline

AMD's AMDGPU driver provides comprehensive tracing of command submission and hardware interrupts.

amdgpu_cs_ioctl captures userspace command submission. When an application submits GPU work via ioctl, this tracepoint fires. Format: `sched_job=12345 timeline=gfx context=1000 seqno=567 ring_name=gfx_0.0.0 num_ibs=2` shows job 12345 submitted to graphics ring with 2 indirect buffers. This marks when userspace hands off work to kernel. Record timestamp to measure submission to execution latency when combined with `amdgpu_sched_run_job`. High frequency indicates small batches and potential for better batching.

amdgpu_sched_run_job fires when the kernel scheduler starts executing a previously submitted job. Comparing timestamps with `amdgpu_cs_ioctl` reveals submission latency. Submission latencies over 100Î¼s indicate kernel scheduling delays. Per-ring latencies show if specific engines are scheduling-bound.

amdgpu_bo_create tracks buffer object allocation, AMD's equivalent to i915 GEM objects. Format: `bo=0xffff888... pages=256 type=2 preferred=4 allowed=7 visible=1` allocates 1MB (256 pages). Type indicates VRAM vs GTT (system memory accessible by GPU). Preferred/allowed domains show placement policy. Type mismatches where VRAM is requested but GTT is used indicate VRAM exhaustion. Visible flag indicates CPU-accessible memory, which is expensive and should be used sparingly.

amdgpu_bo_move fires when buffer objects migrate between VRAM and GTT. Migrations are expensive because they require copying data over PCIe. Excessive moves indicate memory thrashing where the working set exceeds VRAM capacity. Measure move frequency and size to quantify PCIe bandwidth consumption. Correlate with performance drops since migrations stall GPU execution.

amdgpu_iv captures GPU interrupts. The GPU signals interrupts for completed work, errors, and events. Format: `ih:0 client_id:1 src_id:42 ring:0 vmid:5 timestamp:1234567890 pasid:100 src_data: 00000001...` captures interrupt details. Source ID indicates interrupt type (completion, fault, thermal). High interrupt rates impact CPU performance. VMID and PASID identify which process/VM triggered the interrupt, which is critical for multi-tenant debugging.

## DRM Vblank Tracepoints: Display Synchronization

Vblank (vertical blanking) events synchronize rendering with display refresh. Missing vblanks causes dropped frames and stutter.

drm_vblank_event fires when the display enters vertical blanking period. Format: `crtc=0 seq=12345 time=1234567890 high-prec=true` indicates vblank on display controller 0, sequence number 12345. Track vblank frequency to verify refresh rate (60Hz = 60 vblanks/second). Missed sequences indicate frame drops. High-precision timestamps enable sub-millisecond frame timing analysis.

drm_vblank_event_queued and drm_vblank_event_delivered track vblank event delivery to userspace. Queuing latency (queue to delivery) measures kernel scheduling delay. Total latency (vblank to delivery) includes both kernel and driver processing. Latencies over 1ms indicate compositor problems. Correlate with frame drops visible to users since events delivered late mean missed frames.

## NVIDIA Proprietary Driver: Different Architecture

Unlike Intel, AMD, and Nouveau which use the kernel's Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) subsystem, NVIDIA's proprietary driver (nvidia.ko) operates outside DRM. It implements its own kernel module interface with vendor-specific functions and a single tracepoint. This architectural difference means NVIDIA GPUs require different monitoring approaches; we attach to kernel probes on nvidia.ko functions instead of DRM tracepoints.

The key distinction: DRM drivers expose standardized `gpu_scheduler` tracepoints that work identically across vendors. NVIDIA's closed-source driver provides only one tracepoint (`nvidia:nvidia_dev_xid` for hardware errors) and requires monitoring internal kernel functions like `nvidia_open`, `nvidia_unlocked_ioctl`, and `nvidia_isr`. This makes NVIDIA monitoring more fragile since function names can change between driver versions, but it still provides valuable insights into GPU activity.

### NVIDIA Driver Monitoring: nvidia_driver.bt

The `nvidia_driver.bt` script tracks NVIDIA GPU operations through kernel probes on the proprietary driver. Unlike DRM scheduler monitoring which is vendor-neutral, this script is NVIDIA-specific and requires the proprietary nvidia.ko module loaded.

The script monitors six key areas:
- **Device operations**: Tracks when processes open/close GPU devices and issue ioctl commands
- **Memory management**: Records mmap operations, page faults, and VMA lifecycle
- **Interrupt handling**: Measures ISR latency from hardware interrupt to processing
- **P2P communication**: Captures GPU-to-GPU page requests and DMA mapping
- **Power management**: Times suspend/resume cycles
- **Error reporting**: Reports Xid hardware/driver errors immediately

### Understanding NVIDIA Driver Operations

Device Operations: `nvidia_open` fires when a process opens `/dev/nvidia0` (or other GPU device nodes). This is the entry point for GPU access. CUDA applications, OpenGL contexts, and compute workloads all start here. Track `@opens[comm]` to see which applications use the GPU. Each open usually corresponds to a CUDA context or graphics context creation.

IOCTL Commands: `nvidia_unlocked_ioctl` is the highest-frequency operation. Every GPU command submission, memory allocation, synchronization, and query goes through ioctls. A single frame of graphics rendering may issue hundreds of ioctls. The script samples 1% of ioctls to reduce overhead while maintaining visibility. High ioctl rates (>100k/sec) indicate fine-grained GPU interactions and potential for better batching. The `arg1` parameter contains the ioctl command code identifying the operation type.

Memory Mapping: `nvidia_mmap` maps GPU memory into process virtual address space, enabling CPU access to GPU buffers. Format `offset=0x100000 size=1048576` maps 1MB of GPU memory. Track `@total_mmap_bytes` to understand GPU memory usage. Frequent large mmaps may indicate CPU-GPU data transfer patterns. Unified memory (CUDA managed memory) triggers extensive mmap activity as the driver migrates pages between CPU and GPU.

Page Faults: `nvidia_fault` captures expensive events when CPU or GPU accesses unmapped memory. Page faults stall execution while the driver resolves the mapping. High fault counts indicate unified memory page migration under memory pressure, incomplete memory binding before kernel launch, or CPU accessing GPU memory without proper mapping. Correlate faults with performance drops. Faults during critical sections (kernel execution) directly impact throughput.

Interrupt Handling: `nvidia_isr` fires when the GPU signals an interrupt, typically for completed work, errors, or synchronization events. Modern GPUs use MSI-X interrupts for lower latency. The bottom-half handler (`nvidia_isr_kthread_bh`) performs the actual work processing. ISR latency (time from hardware interrupt to bottom-half processing) indicates kernel scheduling efficiency. High ISR rates (>10k/sec) may impact CPU performance since each interrupt costs CPU cycles.

P2P Transfers: `nvidia_p2p_get_pages` and `nvidia_p2p_dma_map_pages` enable direct GPU-to-GPU transfers over NVLink or PCIe without CPU involvement. Multi-GPU workloads (distributed training, GPU clusters) rely on P2P for high bandwidth. Track P2P operations to verify GPU-GPU communication is working. Missing P2P support (older PCIe configurations) forces slower CPU-mediated transfers.

Xid Errors: The `nvidia:nvidia_dev_xid` tracepoint is NVIDIA's only exposed tracepoint. Xid errors indicate hardware problems (GPU faults, memory errors, thermal issues) or driver bugs. Common Xids include Xid 31 (GPU memory page fault), Xid 43 (GPU stopped responding/hang), Xid 45 (GPU memory ECC error), and Xid 79 (GPU fell off the bus/PCIe error). Any Xid error requires investigation since they often precede crashes or data corruption.

### Running NVIDIA Driver Monitor

Verify NVIDIA driver is loaded and check available probes:

```bash
# Check NVIDIA driver module
lsmod | grep nvidia

# List available NVIDIA probes
sudo bpftrace -l 'kprobe:nvidia_*' | head -20
sudo bpftrace -l 'tracepoint:nvidia:*'
```

Run the monitor during GPU workloads:

```bash
cd bpf-developer-tutorial/src/xpu/gpu-kernel-driver
sudo bpftrace scripts/nvidia_driver.bt
```

**Analysis**: This real-world trace reveals several patterns. The llama-server process opened the GPU device 39 times during initialization - typical for LLM inference engines that initialize multiple CUDA contexts for different model layers or batching strategies. The 422 ioctls from llama-server indicate active inference work. The nvtop monitoring tool issued 2,357 ioctls polling GPU state. The script captured 38 device closes from a terminating CUDA application (cuda00001400006) and 8 from a Python process - showing cleanup patterns. The 24,254 poll calls indicate high async I/O activity from monitoring tools. Zero page faults suggests all memory was properly pre-allocated. Zero ISR events during this capture window indicates the GPU was between computation batches - ISRs fire when GPU work completes. No Xid errors means healthy hardware operation. The currently-open PID 800150 (llama-server) remained active after the trace ended.

## Running the Monitor Scripts

Navigate to the tutorial directory and run the appropriate monitor for your GPU.

**For DRM-based GPUs (Intel, AMD, Nouveau)** - Universal monitoring:

cd bpf-developer-tutorial/src/xpu/gpu-kernel-driver
sudo bpftrace scripts/drm_scheduler.bt
```

**For NVIDIA Proprietary Driver**:

```bash
cd bpf-developer-tutorial/src/xpu/gpu-kernel-driver
sudo bpftrace scripts/nvidia_driver.bt
```

Expected output:

```

Graphics jobs dominate (1523 vs 89 compute jobs). Few dependency waits (12) indicate good pipeline parallelism. For Intel GPUs, use `intel_i915.bt`. For AMD GPUs, use `amd_amdgpu.bt`. For display timing, use `drm_vblank.bt`. Run these during GPU workloads (gaming, ML training, video encoding) to capture activity patterns.

Verify tracepoints exist on your system before running scripts:

```bash
# All GPU tracepoints
sudo cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/available_events | grep -E '(gpu_scheduler|i915|amdgpu|^drm:)'
```

## Limitations: Kernel Tracing vs GPU-Side Observability

This tutorial focuses on kernel-side GPU driver tracing, which provides visibility into job scheduling, memory management, and driver-firmware communication. However, kernel tracepoints have fundamental limitations. When `drm_run_job` fires, we know a job started executing on GPU hardware, but we cannot observe what happens inside the GPU itself. The execution of thousands of parallel threads, their memory access patterns, branch divergence, warp occupancy, and instruction-level behavior remain invisible. These details are critical for understanding performance bottlenecks - whether memory coalescing is failing, whether thread divergence is killing efficiency, or whether shared memory bank conflicts are stalling execution.

To achieve fine-grained GPU observability, eBPF programs must run directly on the GPU. This is the direction explored by the eGPU paper and [bpftime GPU examples](https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/bpftime/tree/master/example/gpu). bpftime converts eBPF bytecode to PTX instructions that GPUs can execute, then dynamically patches CUDA binaries at runtime to inject these eBPF programs at kernel entry/exit points. This enables observing GPU-specific information like block indices, thread indices, global timers, and warp-level metrics. Developers can instrument critical paths inside GPU kernels to measure execution behavior and diagnose complex performance issues that kernel-side tracing cannot reach. This GPU-internal observability complements kernel tracepoints - together they provide end-to-end visibility from API calls through kernel drivers to GPU execution.

## Summary

GPU kernel tracepoints provide zero-overhead visibility into driver internals. DRM scheduler's stable uAPI tracepoints work across all vendors for production monitoring. Vendor-specific tracepoints expose detailed memory management and command submission pipelines. The bpftrace script demonstrates tracking job scheduling, measuring latency, and identifying dependency stalls - all critical for diagnosing performance issues in games, ML training, and cloud GPU workloads. For GPU-internal observability beyond kernel tracing, explore bpftime's GPU eBPF capabilities.
